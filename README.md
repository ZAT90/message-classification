# Multi-Class Text Classification with Word2Vec

This project uses Word2Vec embeddings and Logistic Regression to classify text messages into two categories: Spam and Ham. The model is capable of handling multi-class classification, meaning it can scale if additional categories are added in the future.

## OverView
The goal of this project is to classify text messages into two categories: Spam and Ham using Word2Vec embeddings and Logistic Regression. The model uses the One-vs-Rest strategy for multi-class classification, which allows it to scale to more categories if needed.

## Techniques Covered
- Word2Vec for converting text into document vectors.
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Label Encoding for multi-class classification.
- Logistic Regression for multi-class classification using the One-vs-Rest strategy.
- Model Evaluation using accuracy and classification report.

## Features
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Word2Vec Embeddings: Converts text into document vectors.
- Logistic Regression: Multi-class classifier using the One-vs-Rest strategy.
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy and classification report.

## Usage
- Load and Preprocess Data: The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed by tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords.
- Generate Document Vectors: The processed text data is transformed into document vectors using Word2Vec embeddings.
- Train the Model: The Logistic Regression model is trained using the document vectors and labels (Spam, Ham).
- Evaluate the Model: After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.

## Dependencies
```
gensim        # Word2Vec embeddings
